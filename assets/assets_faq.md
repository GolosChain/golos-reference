Assets FAQ

General
-------

### What happens to the asset creation fee?

50% of the asset creation fee are used to pre-fill the assets fee pool.
From the other 50%, 20% go to the network and 80% go to the referral
program. This means, that if you are a life-time member, you get back
40% of the asset creation fee after the vesting period (currently 90
days).

### Can I change x after creation of the asset

The following parameters can be changed after creation:

-   Issuer
-   UIA-Options:

> -   Max Supply
> -   Market Fee
> -   Permissions (disable only/nor re-enable)
> -   Flags (if permissions allow it)
> -   Core exchange rate
> -   White/Black Listing
> -   Description

-   MPG-Options:

> -   Feed Life Time
> -   Minimum Feeds
> -   Force Settlement Offset/Delay/Volume

Things that cannot be changes:

-   Symbol
-   Precision

A tutorial can be found here \<../tutorials/uia-update-manual\>.

### What about Parent and Child assets?

A **parent**/**child** relation ship for assets can be represented by
the name of the symbol, e.g.:

    PARENT.child

can only be created by the issuer of `PARENT` and no one else.

### Changing the issuer

The current issue of an asset may transfer ownership of the asset to
someone else by changing the issuer in the asset's settings.

Fee Pool
--------

### What is the fee pool all about?

The fee pool allows participants in the network to deal with assets and
pay for the transaction fees without the need to hold GOLOS. Any
transaction fee can be paid by paying any asset that has a core exchange
rate (i.e. a price) at which the asset can be exchange implicitly into
GOLOS to cover the network fee. If the asset's fee pool is funded, the
fees can be payed in the native UIA instead of GOLOS.

> **note**
>
> The core exchange rate at which a fee can be exchanged into
> :   GOLOS may differ from the actual market valuation of the asset. A
>     user, thus, may pay a premium or spare funds by paying in GOLOS.
>
> **warning**
>
> Make sure your core exchange rate is higher than the lowest
> :   ask, otherwise, people will buy your token from the market and
>     drain your fee pool via implicit abitrage.
>
It is the task of the issuer to keep the fee pool funded and the core
exchange rate updated unless he wants the owner of his asset to be
required to hold GOLOS for the fee.

### What to do if the fee pool is empty?

Open up the issuer's account, click the assets tab and open up the
dialog to change the asset. There will be a fee pool tab that allows you
to fund the fee pool and claim the accumulated fees!

### What is Fee Pool Draining?

If an order is created and paid in a non-GOLOS asset, the fee is
implicitly exchange into GOLOS to pay the network fee. However, if the
order is canceled, 90% of the fee will be returned as GOLOS. The result
is, that if the core exchange rate is lower than the highest bid, people
can simply buy your token from the market, and exchange them implicitly
with the fee pool by creating and canceling an order. This will deplete
the fee pool and leave the issuer with his tokens at a slight loss
(depending on the offset of the core exchange rate). For this reason, we
recommend to use a core exchange that is slightly higher than the market
price of your asset. As a consequence, paying fees in GOLOS should always
be cheaper.

Market Fees
-----------

### What happens if I enable Market fees?

If *Market Fees* of a UIA are turned on, fees have to be payed for each
**market transaction**. This means, that market fees only apply to
**filled orders**!

The percentage of market fees that are applied can be defined and
changed by the issuer and any fee generated that way will be accumulated
for each asset only to be claimed by the issuer.

If the Market Fee is set to 1%, the issuer will earn 1% of market volume
as profit. These profits are accumulated for each UIA and can be
withdrawn by the issuer.

### How to claim accumulated fees?

Open up the issuer's account, click the assets tab and open up the
dialog to change the asset. There will be a fee pool tab that allows you
to fund the fee pool and claim the accumulated fees!

### What if two different market fees are involved in a trade?

Suppose, I set the market fee for MyUIA market at 0.1%. and the market
fee for YourUIA market at 0.3%.

In BitShares, You pay the fee upon **receiving an asset**. Hence, one
side will pay 0.3% the other will pay 0.1%.

What are Asset Flags and Permissions?
-------------------------------------

When an asset is creatd, the issuer can set any combination of
flags/permissions. **Flags** are set in stone unless there is
**permission** to edit. Once a permission to edit is revoked, flags are
permanent, and can never be modified again.

### What are the Permissions:

-   Enable market fee
-   Require holders to be white-listed
-   Issuer may transfer asset back to himself
-   Issuer must approve all transfers
-   Disable confidential transactions

### What are the Flags?

-   `charge_market_fee`: an issuer-specified percentage of all market
    trades in this asset is paid to the issuer
-   `white_list`: accounts must be white-listed in order to hold this
    asset
-   `override_authority`: issuer may transfer asset back to himself
-   `transfer_restricted`: require the issuer to be one party to every
    transfer
-   `disable_force_settle`: disable force settling
-   `global_settle`: (only for bitassets) allows bitasset issuer to
    force a global settling - this may be set in permissions, but should
    not be set as flag unless, for instance, a prediction market has to
    be resolved. If this flag has been enabled, no further shares can be
    borrowed!
-   `disable_confidential`: allow the asset to be used with confidential
    transactions
-   `witness_fed_asset`: allow the asset to be fed by witnesses
-   `committee_fed_asset`: allow the asset to be fed by the committee

Market Pegged Assets
--------------------

### Can I use the same flags/permissions as for UIAs?

Yes!

### What are market-pegged-asset-specific parameters

-   `feed_lifetime_sec`: The lifetime of a feed. After this time (in
    seconds) a feed is no longer considered *valid*.
-   `minimum_feeds`: The number of feeds required for a market to become
    (and stay) active.
-   `force_settlement_delay_sec`: The delay between requesting a
    settlement and actual execution of settlement (in seconds)
-   `force_settlement_offset_percent`: A percentage offset from the
    price feed for settlement (100% = 10000)
-   `maximum_force_settlement_volume`: Maximum percentage of the supply
    that can be settled per day (100% = 10000)
-   `short_backing_asset`: The asset that has to be used to *back* this
    asset (when borrowing)
