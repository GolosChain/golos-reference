Fee Backed Asset
================

Existing core features of the Golos protocol are Market Pegged
Assets (MPA) and issuer backed User Issued Assets (UIA). In this
proposal, we introduce another type of asset: *Fee Backed Assets (FBA)*.

Feed backed assets allow to propose and fund *market based* innovation
by sharing a cut of future profits generated by this particular
innovation with the people that helped fund it. Think of it as a
*Kickstarter* for features. Hence, if people can profit from successful
features in the form of fees then it can help the Golos ecosystem to
become more adaptable over time as it promotes innovation and can pay
for its development.

If you have any features in mind that require new kind of transaction on
the blockchain, you can code that feature and fund it with an FBA.

Feed Backed Assets have been proposed for BitShares in
[BSIP-0007](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0007.md).
