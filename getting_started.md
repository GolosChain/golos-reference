Choose your Client
------------------

Several ways existing to enter the Golos network that focus on
different aspects. To actually interact with the Golos ecosystem,
you can either

-   [Use or setup the official webclient "Tolstoy"](https://github.com/GolosChain/tolstoy)
-   or access the network in the browsers via one of our partners: [Golos.io](https://golos.io) or [GoldVoice.club](https://goldvoice.club)

All of these solutions have one thing in common: **You have sole control of your accounts and funds** and they are created on your computer. Hence, you will only be able to access your account on the computer that you have used to register and create your account, unless you export your wallet and import it somewhere else.


The Starters
------------

-   **Security and Control over accounts and funds**: No one can access
    your funds unless you let them, intentionally, or unintentionally.
    With the power to be independent from 3rd parties, comes the
    responsibility to protect what belongs to you \<security\>.
-   **Can interact with people directly**: With Golos it becomes
    possible to interact with people directly without needing to go
    through a middleman. Hence, Golos is a platform of free speech
    that implements a payment platform and exchange for digital goods.
-   **Fast**: Transactions in Golos are verified and irrevocable in
    only a few seconds time.
-   **Flexible**: Protocol upgrades (formerly known as *hard forks*) can
    be implemented and executed to improve the Golos business over
    time and allow to react on external influences quickly.

The Investors
-------------

-   **Become Shareholder**: If you buy `GOLOS` either from a partner
    exchange or from the DEX, you become a shareholder of the Golos
    decentralized business and as such can take a cut of its profits and
    participate in votes for future directions.
-   **Leaders**: Participate in political decisions by voting for
    witnesses that represent your views!

Accounts, Wallets, Keys: Terminology!
-------------------------------------

Most clients distinguish between accounts from wallets and all of they
use keys to access funds. Let's quickly clarify the terms here:

-   **Keys**: Keys refer to the cryptography used to secure access to
    your account and funds. It is of importance to prevent others from
    gaining access to these. This is why you have to provide a
    passphrase that is used to store the keys in an encrypted way.
-   **Accounts**: Each user has at least one account that can be used to
    interact with the blockchain. In the end, this can be seen as a
    single banking account with an individual balance, transaction
    history, etc. Since these accounts are registered on the blockchain
    and are open to the public, we recommend to pick a pseudonym to
    achieve some privacy. The advantage of using account names is that
    people can identify you by using a readable and memorable word
    instead of cryptographic addresses.
-   **Wallet**: Since users can (if they have a lifetime membership)
    register multiple accounts in parallel, all of them are stored in a
    single wallet. Hence, a wallet can carry many accounts. Furthermore,
    users can create multiple wallets to organize their accounts
    properly.
