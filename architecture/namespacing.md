Namespacing
-----------

- This is `theoreticalbts` idea for an interesting feature

Many user-bases already exist, and some of these may have name collisions.  Common names like `dan` or `nathan` are probably
already registered on Github, Linkedin, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, etc. and probably belong to different people on all these services.
If our business model is to convince online services to migrate their user bases, then we should give them a way to namespace these
accounts.  E.g. `github/dan`, `github/nathan` etc., in general a registration of `a/b` must be approved by account `a`.

Should this reflect referral structure.  For example if `a` is your referrer, then your name is `a/b`.  New accounts are always `a/b`,
but can be promoted to `b` by buying out.  Hmm, seems like the buyout should also give you an opportunity to change your name (since
root NS might have conflicts), and this change should be name-blinded.
