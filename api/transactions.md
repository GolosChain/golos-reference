Transactions and Operations
===========================

Golos implements a variety of operations besides simple
transfers of funds. For instance in order to operate the
decentralized exchange we need support for buy, sell orders as well. Posting, voting, reward retrieving are also transactions with operations inside.
 
Full reference for all the operation types can be found in our [here](https://developers.golos.io/golos-v0.17.0/d6/d7a/group__operations.html).
