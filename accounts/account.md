Accounts
========

Golos accounts have to be registered on the blockchain. Upon registration they are assigned an incrementing identifier (account id).

This comes with many advantages: Besides improved scalability, we have
separated the identity from the transaction authorizing signature. In
practice, *owning an account name* is independent from being able to
*spend its funds*. Furthermore, both rights (we call them *permissions*)
can split among an arbitrary complex relation of people (we call them
*authorities*) using *weights* and a required *thresholds*.

Thanks to separating *authorities* from *identities*, Golos can be much faster in processing delay while having much smaller transaction
sizes. Hence, all participants are forced to have a named account on the
blockchain. Furthermore, most transactions are tied to an account name
and can thus be linked to individuals (this includes transferes, trades,
shorts, etc. but not *stealthed* transactions).
