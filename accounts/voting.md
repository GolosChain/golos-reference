Voting
======

If you hold some `GOLOS` tokens, you are considered a shareholder of the
Golos business and thus have a say in where it should be heading in
future. As a shareholder you can cast a vote for a couple of different entities within the network:

- **Block producers** bundle transactions into blocks and sign them
    with their signing key. These so called *witnesses* keep the
    blockchain alive by producing one block every few seconds and get
    paid by newly issued GOLOS shares similar to Bitcoin. Their second job
    is to produce reliable and accurate price feeds for the smartcoins.
- **Content** is getting posted by users and rewarded by shareholders votes.

Since voting might be a too time-consuming task for many shareholders,
Golos offers them a way to delegate their voting power to so called
**proxies**. The sole purpose of proxies is to follow the ecosystem and
be vote according to their *followers*. This is similar to many
political votes where citizens vote for representatives which vote on
their behalf.
