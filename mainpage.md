Welcome to Golos Blockchain developer documentation! {#mainpage}
=====================================================

Golos is a socio-economic blockchain database that supports community building and social interaction with cryptocurrency rewards. Golos combines concepts from social media with lessons learned from building cryptocurrencies and their communities. An important key to inspiring participation in any community, currency or free market economy is a fair accounting system that consistently reflects each person's contribution. 

Golos is mostly the result of [Steem](https://github.com/steemit) and [BitShares](https://github.com/bitshares) blockchains merge and contains the best features from both of them. 

This particular documentation contains generic description of principles the business logic works applied to the most widely used [implementation](https://github.com/GolosChain/golos) of Golos Blockchain daemon.
