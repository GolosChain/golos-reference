Howto trade in the DEX
======================

The decentralized exchange (DEX) of Golos has a similar look&feel as BitShares' one& However, trading in the DEX can have many different appearances, depending on what user-interface is used. We here describe the user interface of the official wallet. We recommend to
also read through:

-   ../user/dex
-   ../user/dex-trading

Placing Orders
--------------

Orders can be placed in the same way as everywhere else, by providing

-   the amount to buy/sell
-   the price at which to buy/sell

Fees
----

In contrast to other exchanges, Golos asks for a tiny **flat fee**
for placing an order. This fee can be payed in USD, BTC, or GOLD and is
independent of the actual assets that are traded.

If you cancel an order that has not been fully or partially filled, 90%
of the fee will be payed back to your account. However, this chargeback
will be in `GOLOS` and not in the asset you have originally paid the fee
in.
