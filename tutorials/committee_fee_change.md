How Committee Proposes a Change in Fee
======================================

Create an Proposal
------------------

Let's assume we want to propose a new fee for the account creation
operation. We want 5 BTS as basic fee and want premium names to cost
2000 BTS. Additionally, a price per kbyte for the account creation
transaction can be defined. We get

``` {.sourceCode .js}
{
 "account_create_operation" : {
           "basic_fee"      : 500000,
           "premium_fee"    : 200000000,
           "price_per_kbyte": 100000}
}
```

We propose the fee change for account `<committee_member>` with::

    >>> propose_fee_change <committee_member> "2015-10-14T15:29:00" {"account_create_operation" : {"basic_fee": 500000, "premium_fee": 200000000, "price_per_kbyte": 100000}} false

Approve Proposal
----------------

Now we need to convince the other committee members to approve. We can
do so on the blockchain by asking them for approval with :

    >>> approve_proposal <committee_member> "1.10.1" {"active_approvals_to_add" : ["<MY-COMMITTEE-MEMBER>"]} true

where `1.10.1` is the id of the proposal in question.
