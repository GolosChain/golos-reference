How to Run and Use the Cli-Wallet
=================================

The Cli-Wallet is used to interact with the blockchain. Everything that
adds new data to the blockchain requires a signature from a private key.
These signed transactions can be produced by the cli-wallet.

Download and Install the Witness Node
-------------------------------------

We first need to download, (compile) and install the cli-wallet. All
that is needed is described here:

To reduce compilation time, you can tell the compile infrastructure to
only compile the witness node by running.

``` {.sourceCode .sh}
$ make cli-wallet
```

instead of

``` {.sourceCode .sh}
$ make
```

Executing the cli-wallet
------------------------

All it takes for the cli-wallet to run is a trusted **public API
server** to interface with the blockchain. These public API servers are
run by businesses and individuals \<full-node-usage\>. In this example,
we use the public API node of OpenLedger and connect via secured
websocket connection:

    wss://bitshares.openledger.info/ws

``` {.sourceCode .sh}
./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet -s wss://bitshares.openledger.info/ws
```

This will open the cli-wallet and unless you already have a local
wallet, will ask you to provide a passphrase for your local wallet. Once
a wallet has been created (default wallet file is `wallet.json`), it
will prompt with

    locked >>> 

The wallet can be unlocked by providing the passphrase:

> **note**
>
> The passphrase is given in clear text and is echoed by the
> :   wallet!
>
    locked >>> unlock "supersecretpassphrase"
    null
    unlocked >>> 

After this point, you can issue any command available to the
cli-wallet \<../../api/wallet-api\> or construct your own
transaction manually \<construct-transaction\>.

You can get more detailed information either by pressing Tab, twice, or
by issuing `help`. Detailed explanations for most calls are available
via

    unlocked >> gethelp <command>

> **note**
>
> Many calls have a obligatory `broadcast`-flag as last
> :   argument. If this flag is `False`, the wallet will construct and
>     sign, but **not** broadcast the transaction. This can be very
>     useful for a cold storage setup or to verify transactions.

Opening RPC port
----------------

The cli-wallet can open a RPC port so that you can interface your
application with it. You have the choices of

-   websocket RPC via the `-r` parameter, and
-   HTTP RPC via the `-H` parameter:

``` {.sourceCode .sh}
./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet -s wss://bitshares.openledger.info/ws -H 127.0.0.1:8092 -r 127.0.0.1:8093
```
