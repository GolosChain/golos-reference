Transfering Funds using the cli-wallet
======================================

Once we have the cli-wallet set up \<cli-wallet-usage\>, we can transfer
funds easily with the following syntax:

    unlocked >> transfer <from> <to> <amount> <asset> <memo> <broadcast>

> **note**
>
> In order to transfer, the wallet must be unlocked. If the
> :   broadcast flag is `False`, the wallet will construct and sign, but
>     **not** broadcast the transaction. This can be very useful for a
>     cold storage setup or to verify transactions.

If alice wants to send 10 USD to bob, she could call::

    unlocked >> transfer alice bob 10 USD "a gift" true

The wallet will return the actual signed transaction.
