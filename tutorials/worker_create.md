How to Create a Worker
======================

Workers are currently created with the cli\_wallet with the following
command syntax::

    >>> create_worker owner_account work_begin_date work_end_date daily_pay name url worker_settings broadcast

example, `owner_account` is creating a one day worker starting Oct 28
and will get paid 1 BTS/day (vesting in 1 day, 1 BTS = 100,000
'satoshi') to make an android app. The first command won't broadcast,
this will just check::

    >>> create_worker "worker-name" "2015-10-28T00:00:00" "2015-10-29T00:00:00" 100000 "Description" "http://URL" {"type" : "vesting", "pay_vesting_period_days" : 1} false

The URL should point to something describing your proposal. We recommend
to answer the following questions:

> -   What will you do with the funds?
> -   By when will you be done?
> -   For how much?

The variable `type` can be

-   `refund` to return your pay back to the pool to be used for future
    projects,
-   `vesting` to pay that you pay yourself, or
-   `burn` to destroys your pay thus reducing share supply, equivalent
    to share buy-back of a company stock

The variable `pay_vesting_period_days` is the integer number of days you
set for vesting. Some people don't want workers to withdraw and sell
large sums of BTS immediately, as it puts sell pressure on BTS. Also, if
you require vesting, you have "skin in the game" and thus an incentive
to improve BTS value. Pay is pay per day (not hour or maintenance
period) and is in units of 1/100,000 BTS (the precision of BTS)

To **actually** generate a worker proposal, replace the last `false` by
`true`.

How to see proposals on the chain
---------------------------------

Since there is no support in the UI yet, go to <http://cryptofresh.com/>
and look at the worker proposal chart. You also can inspect all the
objects 1.4.\*::

    >>> get_object 1.14.4
    get_object 1.14.4
    [{
        "id": "1.14.4",
        "worker_account": "1.2.22517",
        "work_begin_date": "2015-10-21T11:00:00",
        "work_end_date": "2015-11-21T11:00:00",
        "daily_pay": 1000000000,
        "worker": [
          1,{
            "balance": "1.13.235"
          }
        ],
        "vote_for": "2:73",
        "vote_against": "2:74",
        "total_votes_for": "14632377015617",
        "total_votes_against": 0,
        "name": "bitasset-fund-pool",
        "url": "https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,19317.0.html"
      }
    ]

How to Vote for a Worker
------------------------

Currently the GUI doesn't have an interface, but you an vote using the
CLI::

    >>> update_worker_votes your-account {"vote_for":["proposal-id"]} true

for example::

    >>> update_worker_votes "awesomebitsharer" {"vote_for":["1.4.0"]} true

you can also vote against or abstain (remove your vote for or against):

    >>> update_worker_votes your-account {"vote_against":["proposal-id"]} true
    >>> update_worker_votes your-account {"vote_abstain":["proposal-id"]} true

How Workers Get Paid
--------------------

Every hour the worker budget is processed and workers are paid in full
order of the number of votes for minus the number of votes against. The
last worker to get paid will be paid with whatever is left, so may
receive partial payment. The daily budget can be estimated by inspecting
the most recent budget object 2.13.\* for example::

    >>> get_object 2.13.361
    get_object 2.13.361
    [{
        "id": "2.13.361",
        "time": "2015-10-28T15:00:00",
        "record": {
          "time_since_last_budget": 3600,
          "from_initial_reserve": "106736452914941",
          "from_accumulated_fees": 15824269,
          "from_unused_witness_budget": 2250000,
          "requested_witness_budget": 180000000,
          "total_budget": 1520913100,
          "witness_budget": 180000000,
          "worker_budget": 1340913100,
          "leftover_worker_funds": 0,
          "supply_delta": 1502838831
        }
      }
    ]

So the daily budget is:

    worker_budget*24 = 1340913100 * 24 = 32181914400 (or 321,8191.44 BTS)

There is currently a maximum daily worker pay of 500k BTS, and this can
be found using the `get_global_properties` command in the cli\_wallet

Technical Details
-----------------

Every second, :

    [ 17/(2^32) * reserve fund ]

is allocated for witnesses and workers. The reserve fund is maximum
number of BTS available less those currently in circulation
([source](https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene/blob/f85dec1c23f6bf9259ad9f15311b2e4aac4f9d44/libraries/chain/include/graphene/chain/config.hpp))

Every hour the total available reserve fund is calculated by finding how
many BTS are available to be distributed and how many BTS will be
returned to the reserve fund (i.e., "burnt") during the next maintenance
interval.

First find how many BTS have not been distributed::

    >>> from_initial_reserve = max_supply - current supply of BTS

The max\_supply can be obtained by:

    >>> get_object 1.3.0

and the current\_supply is given in:

    >>> get_object 2.3.0

Modify it by adding the accumulated fees and witness budget remaining
(i.e., 1.5 BTS per block is budgeted, so budget remaining is 1.5 BTS \*
(number of blocks left in maintenance period+blocks missed by
witnesses)) in this maintenance cycle (they will be added to the
"reserve fund" permanently at maintenance):

    updated reserve fund = from_initial_reserve + from_accumulated_fees + from_unused_witness_budget

variables all from: `get_object 2.13.*` (choose the most recent one, for
example)

Next calculate how much is available to be spent on workers and
witnesses is::

    total_budget = (updated reserve fund)*(time_since_last_budget)*17/(2^32)

rounded up to the nearest integer

Ok, now to find how much workers will get in this budget period (1
hour), you find the smaller of the available pay AFTER subtracting
witness budget from the `total_budget` OR the `worker_budget_per_day/24`
from `get_global_properties`:

    worker_budget=min( total_budget - witness_budget , worker_budget_per_day / 24 )

That is how much per hour allocated for all workers. NOW you rank each
worker and pay them one hours worth of pay in order or \# votes.
