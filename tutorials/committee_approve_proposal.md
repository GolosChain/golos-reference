How to Approve/Disapprove a Committee Proposal
==============================================

Approve Proposal
----------------

Now we need to convince the other committee members to approve. We can
do so on the blockchain by asking them for approval with :

    >>> approve_proposal <fee-paying-account> <proposal-id> {"active_approvals_to_add" : ["<MY-COMMITTEE-MEMBER>"]} true

where `<proposal-id>` takes the form `1.10.xxx` and identifies the
actual proposal to approve.

Removeing Approval
------------------

A previous approval can also be removed if the proposal is not yet
expired, executed or within the preview period. This is done by::

    >>> approve_proposal <fee-paying-account> <proposal-id> {"active_approvals_to_remove" : ["<MY-COMMITTEE-MEMBER>"]} true

Note that we now use `active_approvals_to_remove` instead of
`active_approvals_to_add`.
