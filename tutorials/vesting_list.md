List Vesting Balances
=====================

The vesting balances of an account can be seen from::

\>\>\> get\_vesting\_balances \<account-name\>

and takes the form:

``` {.sourceCode .js}
[{
    "id": "1.13.241",
    "owner": "1.2.282",
    "balance": {
      "amount": 4158699804,
      "asset_id": "1.3.0"
    },
    "policy": [
      1,{
        "vesting_seconds": 7776000,
        "start_claim": "1970-01-01T00:00:00",
        "coin_seconds_earned": "16408550952570000",
        "coin_seconds_earned_last_update": "2016-02-08T09:00:00"
      }
    ],
    "allowed_withdraw": {
      "amount": 2114844530,
      "asset_id": "1.3.0"
    },
    "allowed_withdraw_time": "2016-02-08T11:26:12"
  }
]
```

The `balance` gives the total vesting balance (amount plus asset),
whereas `allowed_withdraw` shows the balance that can be withdrawn
already. The object also tells us that the vesting policy is in terms of
coin-days accrued (in contrast to linear vesting).
